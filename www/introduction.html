<b>"Let us proclaim to every soul. - Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached. Arise, Awake from hypnotism of this weakness.</b>
<p>
None is really weak; the soul is infinite, omnipotent and omniscient. Stand up, assert yourself, proclaim the GOD within you, do not deny him! 

Too much of inactivity, too much of weakness, too much of hypnotism, has been & is upon our race. O ye modern Hindus, de-hypnotise yourselves. 

The way to do that is found in your own sacred books. Teach yourself, teach everyone his real nature, call upon the sleeping soul and see how it awakes.Power will come, glory will come, goodness will come, purity will come, everything that is excellent will come when this sleeping soul is roused to self-conscious activity.

Ay, If there is anything in the Gita that I like , it is these verses, coming out strong as the very gist, the very essence, of Krishna's teaching "He who sees the supreme Lord dwelling alike in all beings, the Imperishable in the things that perish, he sees indeed. For seeing the Lord as the same, everywhere present, he does not destroy the self by the self, and thus he goes to the highest goal."</p>
